The repository contains the solution for the *Graded Assignment: Python Lab Sheet* in the *Databases and Cloud* module.

The structure of the repository: 
- `main.py` - description TBA
- `schema.sql` - description TBA
- `test_queries.sql` - description TBA
- `flight_management.db` - description TBA

The CLI application can be tested via GitHub Codespaces. Install the following extensions in VS Code:
- `Python` (by Microsoft)
- `SQLite` (by alexcvzz)
- `SQLite Viewer` (by Florian Klampfer)

To launch the application, run the following commands: 
- `cd /workspaces/GradedAssignmentPythonLabSheet` - navigate to the root folder of the reposity
- `python main.py` - launch the application

The executed `python main.py` will create the `flight_management.db` database and populate it with the mock data. The SQL queries in the test_queries.sql file can be use to verify that the database has been created and populated with the data. 

Once the application has launched, the user will be presented with a CLI-menu and prompted to select one of the options.
